October: 
- Select a few APIs (MBTA, tomtom), gather the necessary data 
- Clean data - Gabe
- Making or finding plots, graphs, etc. - Atharva/Ayush
- Writing and answering questions related to the model and other aspects of code - Daniel


The central motivation of the project is to identify patterns within the MBTA, specifically seasonal passenger traffic and delays 
within the system. Passengers are able to use this data to make more optimal choices regarding commuting, and the MBTA can use this 
data to find areas where attention and maintenance are encouraged/necessary, and maybe find potential areas of expansion to serve 
underrepresented communities. 


Questions to ask:
1. What time of day are delays in the MBTA most common? And what areas are the most affected? 
Using this, commuters will know which areas are more prone to delays and may use other forms of transit. In addition, this can also 
show areas the MBTA needs improvement. We can also expand this to which lines/buses of the MBTA are most prone to delays.

2. What seasons/months have the highest passenger traffic, and how does this affect the frequency of trains? 
If train service isnâ€™t more frequent towards busier times of the year, it might indicate that the MBTA should operate more 
trains/buses during those times and improve reliability and timeliness.
