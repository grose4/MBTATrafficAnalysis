The central motivation of the project is to identify patterns within the MBTA, specifically seasonal passenger traffic and delays 
within the system. Passengers are able to use this data to make more optimal choices regarding commuting, and the MBTA can use this 
data to find areas where attention and maintenance is most critical. We also hope this analysis could be used to find potential areas of expansion to serve 
underrepresented communities.
